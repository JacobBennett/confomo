### Connecting cyberspace with meatspace, one conference at a time

Built in 4 hours to help me track who I wanted to meet at Laracon 2014, and who I met there who I didn't know yet.

I might turn this into a paid app one day, so if you contribute know that's a potential future thing. But many, many, many more times more likely is that I just keep it free and open so that anyone who wants to make it better, can make it better.

### License

Not sure. Don't steal it? @todo.
