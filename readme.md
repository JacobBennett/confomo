## Confomo
### Connecting your online community with the real world, one conference at a time.

Built in 4 hours to help me track who I wanted to meet at Laracon 2014, and who I met there who I didn't know yet.

### Contributing
Submit an issue for bugs or feature requests, or submit a PR against the `development` branch.

Please note: The project is currently in the middle of a [complete refactor from scratch](https://github.com/mattstauffer/confomo/tree/complete-refactor), so it might be worth [pinging Matt on twitter](http://twitter.com/stauffermatt) to ask about any contributions until the refactor is complete.

### License

Not sure. Don't steal it? @todo.
